## A Little Bit About Me

I am a **mature student** studying on a 3 year undergraduate course in **Computer Science(Game Eng)** at **Newcastle University** in my final year of study.

Looking to get into **programming within the games industry**.

Enjoy web development and know most aspects of it to build a fully working site of any type, from security and databases to design.

## Current Project
View my [current project on GitHub here](https://github.com/Steven-Kirby) to see what im working on at the moment.

## Past Projects
View my [past projects on GitHub here](https://github.com/Steven-Kirby) to see what i have worked on in the past.

**Team Project** - [download app for android(auto 4.9mb)](http://retrohub.co.uk/app.php) (*university*) 

App for local council called seaton valley (Java)

Have a look at some of the code involved for [Seaton-Valley-Council-App](https://github.com/Steven-Kirby/Seaton-Valley-Council-App)

**Website** - [retrohub.co.uk](http://retrohub.co.uk) (*personal*)

retrohub.co.uk is a ecommerce site for selling retro video games such as N64 and PS1, 360 degree view of items photographed in 35 images(not recommended for 3g/4g mobile data viewing). 

**Photo Watermarker** - 

This program was made for a friend who was paying silly prices for a website to watermark her photography with a very simple overlay and needed to upload all her photos to the website. As i had needed one before this i had a half done program and adapted it to her needs.

Before
